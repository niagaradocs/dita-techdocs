I want to make a fresh start with this project. Consider the following goals:
1. Same need to process and refactor html files to same target folders and with flattened structure, toc.xml file and updated href and src links to match. Most of the existing code is fine for that. However, I want to make the following changes:
1. Regular exprsessions are causing frequent errors and costing much time in troubleshooting due to mismatched quotes or brackets caused by supposed raw strings or lack thereof and escaping or not escaping certain characters. If we could use a foolproof way to create search strings using another method (variables, triple quotes, or other) it may save hours of troubleshooting.
2. Keep modular structure but now remove the requirement to find 'unecessary' files/images. I would like to add that maybe later as a separate module - but for now we will assume all images are necessary in the are in the source "graphic" folder.
3. Create a configuration module for setting source, target paths. Start with the current options as included in the current scripts. Keep the input question for "use list" or "type name of folder" but use config file for target and any other options that you think might be good to use. I want to have the ability to easily change source and target if I am on another platform with different paths to the source and target.
4. Keep all appropriate comments and troubleshooting and logging messages.
