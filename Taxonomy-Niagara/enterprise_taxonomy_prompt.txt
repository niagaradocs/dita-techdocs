I'm developing an enterprise product taxonomy for a technology company in the building automation and HVAC industry. I need support from an AI assistant with expertise in:

- Taxonomy and ontology design (including hierarchical, faceted, and semantic models)
- Metadata modeling and controlled vocabularies
- Spreadsheet-based data analysis and transformation (especially Excel)
- Integration of structured and unstructured product data
- Familiarity with the Niagara Framework, JACE controllers, Niagara Supervisor, and related building automation technologies
- Knowledge of best practices from leading taxonomy and information architecture experts, including:
  - Heather Hedden (The Accidental Taxonomist)
  - Patrick Lambe (Organising Knowledge)
  - Joseph Busch (Taxonomy Strategies)
  - David Diamond (Metadata for Content Management)
  - Peter Morville & Louis Rosenfeld (Information Architecture for the World Wide Web)
  - Mike Atherton & Carrie Hane (Designing Connected Content)
  - Thomas R. Gruber (Ontology design for the Semantic Web)
  - Diane Vizine-Goetz (faceted classification, OCLC, LCSH)

I’ve already created a taxonomy model and controlled vocabulary, and I’m now integrating a large set of raw product hierarchy data. I need help with strategy, validation rules, enrichment logic, and possibly evolving the taxonomy into a semantic model.

Please pick up from here and assist me as a strategic and technical partner.
