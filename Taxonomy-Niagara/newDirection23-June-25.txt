Here‚Äôs a handoff-style summary of my Tridium Product Taxonomy Project, designed to help me‚Äîor a future project manager‚Äîquickly get back up to speed after a break, please review this content and attached files and notice that I now talking about a Master Taxonomy Framework with two separate taxonomies: Product Taxonomy and Document Taxonomy. Please review the information and tell me if you think this approach is viable or if I am making a mistake to break up the taxonomies. Note also that I have reconfigured column heading and terms, have added a croswalk table tab and planning on a Governance Tab to help. Please use all you know about my sources and previous work we've done together to provide any insight you deem helpful or corrective.

üß≠ Project Purpose
The goal of this project is to design and implement a Master Taxonomy Framework for Tridium products that supports consistent, structured tagging and classification across documentation, product data, and internal systems. This taxonomy will serve as a foundation for improved discoverability, governance, and alignment between product management and technical documentation.

üéØ Project Goals
Develop a Unified Taxonomy Structure

Define a comprehensive set of fields (e.g., Product Family, SKU, Platform Compatibility, Intent, Audience) that capture both product and documentation dimensions.
Align taxonomy fields with both internal financial/product systems and documentation needs.
Enable Data Integration

Use a Python script to extract and transform raw product hierarchy data into a structured format.
Populate the taxonomy framework with current product data from financial systems.
Support Governance and Scalability

Include metadata such as update frequency, ownership, and usage guidelines.
Ensure the taxonomy can evolve with product changes and documentation requirements.
üìÇ Key Files
Enhanced_Taxonomy_Workbook
Your master taxonomy template. Includes:

Tabs for Product Taxonomy, Documentation Taxonomy, Crosswalk Table, Governance, and Terms.
Finalized column structure but no data yet in most tabs.
Updated_Taxonomy_Data
Output of your Python script. Contains:

A ‚ÄúTaxonomy Data‚Äù sheet with 3,877 rows of product data.
Columns aligned with Product Taxonomy but missing many documentation-specific fields.
Tridium_Taxonomy_1
Source of raw product hierarchy data from financial systems. Used by your script to generate the updated taxonomy data.

‚úÖ Current Progress
Column Alignment Completed
Compared columns across all relevant tabs. A full comparison table is now stored in the ‚ÄúTerms‚Äù tab of the Enhanced Workbook.

Data Readiness

Product Taxonomy: 6 columns matched and ready for import.
Documentation Taxonomy: 0 columns matched; requires enrichment.
Crosswalk Table: Only Product Model matched; other fields like Documentation Tag, OEM Variant, and Mapped Intent need to be derived or manually populated.
Governance Tab includes update frequency and usage guidelines.

üîÑ Next Steps
Import Product Taxonomy Data

Copy or script the transfer of aligned data from Updated_Taxonomy_Data.xlsx into the Product Taxonomy tab.
Plan for Documentation Taxonomy

Identify sources or stakeholders for fields like Intent, Persona, Glossary Term, etc.
Consider using tagging metadata from Heretto or documentation systems.
Crosswalk Table Mapping

Define rules or lookup tables for mapping Product Model to documentation tags and intents.
Collaborate with product managers or tech writers if needed.
Automation Enhancements

Extend your Python script to support multi-tab output or enrichment logic.
Optionally, build validation checks for missing or inconsistent taxonomy fields.
üß† Strategic Considerations
Scalability: Design the taxonomy to accommodate future product lines and evolving documentation formats.
Collaboration: Engage with product management, documentation, and support teams to validate field definitions and mappings.
Governance: Establish a review cadence (e.g., quarterly) and assign ownership for taxonomy updates.
