------- Current Status ---------

You now have a clean and expanded taxonomy file:

All products included

Fully structured hierarchy

Controlled Vocabulary tab present

All terms across both tabs now have consistent, unique IDs (TX-xxxx, CV-xxxx)

Prepopulated metadata is in place where available

* Key Decisions to Remember
Unique IDs are now fully implemented and replace all earlier/test values

Controlled Vocabulary will support tagging (e.g., Functionality, Platform, Audience)

Tagging and expansion of controlled vocab are next steps

Youâ€™re preparing this taxonomy to support documentation, OEM mapping, and semantic alignment (e.g., iiRDS, Haystack, BRICK)
