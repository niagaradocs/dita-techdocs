A Strategic Map: How Your Product Taxonomy Fits into a Bigger Picture

1. Internal Product Taxonomy
   → Core structure of Tridium products, serving as the authoritative source for categorization.

2. Functional Tags
   → Describe what each product does—such as scheduling, alarming, analytics, protocol integration, etc.
   → Enable cross-cutting classification that complements the hierarchy.

3. Standards Tagging (BRICK, Haystack, Niagara Dictionary)
   → Represents external tagging schemas commonly used by Tridium customers.
   → Mapped through compatibility flags or crosswalks, not embedded in hierarchy.

4. Documentation Metadata
   → Supports content reuse, faceted search, and intelligent delivery in systems like Heretto and Zoomin.
   → Fields like Platform Compatibility, Deployment Model, Intended Audience derive from the taxonomy.

5. OEM/Partner Mapping
   → Enables crosswalks between Tridium SKUs and rebranded products sold by OEMs or partners.
   → Supports consistent naming, documentation reuse, and cross-system integration.

Notes:
- Each layer builds on the next to create a flexible, extensible metadata strategy.
- This strategic framework supports both internal clarity and external interoperability.
